## ‚ú® New Feature Ideas for Designer Portfolio Showcase

This section brainstorms features to best leverage XR for showcasing design work, given access to GitHub prototypes, images, videos, case studies, Figma prototypes, and design library screenshots.

### 1. Interactive Project Deep Dive
-   [ ] **Concept:** Allow users to select a project and enter a more immersive "deep dive" space for it.
-   [ ] **Sub-Features:**
    -   [ ] **Spatial Case Study Viewer:**
        -   Display sections of a case study (Problem, Process, Solution, Outcome) on different spatial panels.
        -   Allow users to navigate between these panels.
    -   [ ] **Image & Video Gallery:**
        -   Showcase project images and videos on large spatial displays.
        -   Option for a "theater mode" for videos.
    -   [ ] **Interactive Prototype Viewer (Figma/GitHub):**
        -   **Option A (Web View):** Embed Figma prototypes (if viewable via public link) in a spatial WebView. *Requires careful consideration of performance and XR interaction with WebViews.*
        -   **Option B (Image/GIF Sequence):** For complex/private Figma prototypes or GitHub prototypes, showcase key screens/interactions as a sequence of images or GIFs on spatial panels.
        -   Could be triggered by looking at a "Prototype" panel.
    -   [ ] **3D Model Showcase (If applicable):** If any design projects involved 3D work, display the models spatially, perhaps with annotations.

### 2. Design Library Explorer
-   [ ] **Concept:** Create a dedicated section to showcase contributions to design libraries/systems.
-   [ ] **Sub-Features:**
    -   [ ] **Component Showcase:** Display screenshots or representations of UI components (buttons, cards, forms) on spatial panels.
    -   [ ] **Interactive Style Guide Snippets:** Show key aspects of a style guide (colors, typography, spacing) in a visually appealing spatial layout.
    -   [ ] **"Before & After" or "Contribution Highlight":** If possible, visually demonstrate specific contributions or improvements made to the design library.

### 3. "My Design Philosophy" Section
-   [ ] **Concept:** A more personal section where Roland can express his design philosophy or approach.
-   [ ] **Sub-Features:**
    -   [ ] **Spatial Text & Imagery:** Combine short text blurbs with impactful visuals on spatial panels.
    -   [ ] **Audio Narration (Optional):** Add short audio clips from Roland explaining his thoughts, triggered by looking at certain panels.

### 4. XR-Native Interactions for Portfolio Browsing
-   [ ] **Concept:** Make the act of browsing the portfolio itself a delightful XR experience.
-   [ ] **Sub-Features:**
    -   [ ] **Gaze-based Navigation/Selection:** For hands-free interaction.
    -   [ ] **Controller Support (If applicable for target XR platform):** Allow pointing and clicking with virtual controllers.
    -   [ ] **Spatial "Timeline" or "Map" of Projects:** Instead of a linear carousel, perhaps projects are laid out spatially, and the user can "walk" or "fly" to them. (More ambitious).

### 5. "Behind the Scenes" / Process Showcase
-   [ ] **Concept:** Offer glimpses into the design process.
-   [ ] **Sub-Features:**
    -   [ ] **Sketches & Wireframes Gallery:** Display early-stage design artifacts.
    -   [ ] **Short Video Clips of Process:** e.g., screen recordings of Figma work, user testing snippets.

### Technical Considerations for New Features
-   [ ] Evaluate performance implications of loading many high-resolution images/videos.
-   [ ] Investigate best practices for WebView interaction in Android XR if pursuing embedded Figma prototypes.
-   [ ] Design clear visual cues and affordances for interacting with spatial content.
-   [ ] Ensure all text is highly legible in an XR environment (contrast, font size, placement).
-   [ ] Consider different XR input modalities (gaze, controller, hand tracking if available).

## üêõ Bugs & Issues
-   [ ] *(List any known bugs here)*

## üí° Future Ideas / Wishlist
-   [ ] *(Less defined ideas or long-term goals)*
-   [ ] **Chatbot AI - "Herm the 3rd"**:
    -   Acts as an interactive guide or FAQ for the portfolio.
    -   Could answer questions about projects, Roland's skills, or even tell a joke.
    -   Potential for using a simple NLP model or predefined Q&A.
-   [ ] **Live Feed Integration & Generative Headlines**:
    -   Fetch recent design work/articles from Dribbble, Behance, or design blogs via APIs.
    -   Use a simple text generation model (or even predefined templates) to create "XR-themed" headlines for these fetched items, making it seem like content curated for the viewer's interests within the app.
-   [ ] **Spatial Audio Navigation Cues**:
    -   Incorporate subtle spatial audio cues that guide the user towards interactive elements or different sections of the portfolio. For example, a faint "whoosh" sound could emanate from the direction of the next project in a gallery, or a soft "chime" when looking at a selectable item. This would enhance immersion and intuitiveness, especially for users new to XR environments.
